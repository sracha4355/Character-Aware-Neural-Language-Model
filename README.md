# Character-Aware-Neural-Language-Model
For the .py programs to run change the variables FILEPATH_TO_DATA_FOLDER and FILEPATH_TO_FOLDER_TO_SAVE_MODEL. On the safe side a hardcoded absolute path will work. <br />
To train the model run the .py files in /notebooks. <br /> 
### run notebooks/character_aware_neural_language_final.py to train the model on the WSJ dataset, you need to still provide a filepath to a folder with the wsj data, and the folder must contain all three splits<br />

### run notebooks/character_aware_neural_language_non_english_language.py to train on the UD telugu dataset, you need to still provide a filepath to a folder with the UD data, and the folder must contain all three splits <br/>

### packages needed to run the notebooks successfully, torchviz, torch, spacy, conllu
